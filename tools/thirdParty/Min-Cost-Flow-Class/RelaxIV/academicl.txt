ACADEMIC LICENSE
----------------

This license is designed to guarantee freedom to share and change software for
academic use, but restricting commercial firms from exploiting your knowhow for
their benefit. The precise terms and conditions for using, copying,
distribution, and modification follow.

Terms and Conditions for Using, Copying, Distribution, and Modification
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Program" below refers to source, object and executable code, and a "work
based on the Program" means any derivative work under copyright law: that is a
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

   1. This license applies to you only if you are a member of a noncommercial
      and academic institution, e.g., a university. The license expires as soon
      as you are no longer a member of this institution.

   2. Every publication and presentation for which work based on the Program or
      its output has been used must contain an appropriate citation and
      acknowledgment of the author(s) of the Program.

   3. In order to facilitate keeping track of (correct) usage of this Program,
      you must not distribute the Program as such, with no modifications;
      possible exceptions being "mirror sites" or similar that must be agreed
      upon with the authors or maintainers of the Program. You can, however,
      distribute work based on the Program in source, object, or executable
      form where significant changes are made to the Program, provided that you
      also meet all of the following conditions:

      3.1. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
           whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
           thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge under the terms of
           this License. You must accompany it with this unmodified license
           text.

      3.2. These requirements apply to work based on the Program as a whole. If
           identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
           and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
           themselves, this License does not apply to those sections when you
           distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
           sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program,
           the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
           whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole
           and, thus, to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. You
           must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
           that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      3.3. You must keep track of access to the Program.

      3.4. You must accompany it with the complete corresponding
           machine-readable source code.

      3.5. You must notify the authors of the Program or its current maintainer
           of your distribution and accept to give them, upon request, the list
           of everybody who accessed the program (see point 3.3.).

      If you distribute work based on the program that uses the Program as a
      unmodified library, you should not, in principle, re-distribute the
      Program along with it. Exceptions can be agreed upon with the authors or
      maintainer of the Program.

      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
      means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
      compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
      exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
      the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
       executable.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sub-license, or distribute the Program except
      as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
      modify, sub-license, or distribute the Program is void and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies or rights from you under this License will not
      have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
      compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
      it. However, nothing else grants you permission to use, modify, or
      distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by using,
      modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program),
      you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so and all its terms
      and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
      works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
      original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
      these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
      on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
      responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement, or
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
      excuse you from the conditions of this License.

   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other programs whose
      distribution conditions are different, write to the authors of the
      program to ask for permission. If you are contacted by people who wish to
      incorporate parts of a work derived by the Program that you distribute
      (except those identifiable sections of that work that are not derived
      from the Program and can be reasonably considered independent and
      separate works in themselves mentioned at 3.2.), you still need
      permission from the authors of the original Program.

NO WARRANTY
-----------

   9. Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for
      the program to the extent permitted by applicable law. The copyright
      holders provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
      expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
      warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The
      entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you.
      Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary
      servicing, repair, or correction.

  10. In no event will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify
      and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for
      damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential
      damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including
      but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or
      losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to
      operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has
      been advised of the possibility of such damages.
